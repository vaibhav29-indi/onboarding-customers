# onboarding-customers
This repository is an example of scripts which can be used for onboarding customers instead of just using postman for API calls

** Python for automating the postman requests **

In a previous stint I came across a job taks wherein Postman calls had to be used for the updating of customer profiles to onboard customers.
What I achieved using python-
a. Created the scripts which will copy the data in der format to the server
b. The scripts would create the authorization token.
c. The scipts would then call the REST endpoint to create accounts, upload profile and then download/disable profiles.
Basically the sripts would handle a gamut of tasks which were to be down through the postman earlier.
